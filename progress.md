- Goal: add a second convenience-store stock node for the cash register and let the player collect money from it through the same scene/choice flow.
- Plan: extend stock-node data to support money, wire new money stock conditions/effects, add convenience register scenes/choices, then verify with runtime probes.
- Added money-aware stock-node support:
  `StockNodeDefinition` now has `money`, and new condition/effect variants support `stock_money_gte`, `stock_money_lt`, and `collect_stock_money`.
- Updated runtime helpers and save normalization so money stock is persisted in `stockState` just like item stock.
- Added `convenience_register` to the convenience store with `money: 1800`.
- Reworked `survey_convenience` so it discovers both the shelf and the register, and made it recover gracefully for existing saves that had already found the shelf but not the register.
- Added convenience choices and scenes for:
  `go_to_convenience_register`
  `collect_cash_from_register`
  `leave_convenience_register`
  plus `convenience_register_full`, `convenience_register_low`, and `convenience_register_empty`.
- Verified with a runtime probe:
  convenience intro -> `survey_convenience`
  after survey -> `go_to_convenience_shelf`, `go_to_convenience_register`
  register collects increased money `6500 -> 7100 -> 7700 -> 8300`
  after the third collection the scene became `convenience_register_empty` and only `leave_convenience_register` remained.
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run content:validate` all passed.
- Playwright-based UI verification was not run because `node_modules/playwright` is not present in this workspace.
- Refactored region authoring into `src/game/data/regions/`:
  `shelter/`, `convenience/`, and `kitchen/` now each own their `location.ts`, `choices.ts`, `scenes.ts`, and `events.ts`.
- Top-level `src/game/data/locations.ts`, `choices.ts`, `scenes.ts`, and `events.ts` are now aggregation-only entrypoints so the engine import surface stays stable.
- Updated `OBJECT_MODEL.md` to reflect the new region-module structure and to point edits at `src/game/data/regions/<지역>/...`.
- Removed the kitchen action labeled `배식 줄의 분위기를 읽는다` from `src/game/data/regions/kitchen/location.ts` so the soup kitchen no longer surfaces that ambient-read choice.
- Re-ran `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run content:validate` after the kitchen choice removal; all passed.
- Restarted the local server after rebuilding so the currently running game reflects the updated kitchen action list immediately.
- Implemented a first-pass crafting loop centered on the shelter:
  added material items `woodPlank`, `scrapMetal`, `clothScrap`, added salvage stock nodes to convenience and kitchen, and turned shelter into a craft hub with wall patch / brazier / rain bucket upgrades.
- `sleep_at_shelter` now grants base recovery and gets an extra recovery bonus when `shelter_wall_patch` is built.
- `cook_at_shelter` is now a real action after `shelter_brazier` is built; it consumes `rawRice`, `vegetables`, and `woodPlank` to create `hotMeal`, and shows a failure note/log when ingredients are missing.
- `collect_rainwater_at_shelter` becomes available after `shelter_rain_bucket` is built, grants one `waterBottle`, and resets on day transition.
- Inventory UI no longer renders `사용` buttons for non-consumables, so materials stay visible without looking edible/usable.
- Validation and runtime checks passed:
  `npm run typecheck`
  `npm run build`
  `npm run content:validate`
  direct runtime probe through `.server-dist` confirmed salvage -> crafting -> rain bucket reset -> cooking -> improved sleep flow.
- API smoke test against the restarted local server passed:
  after convenience survey, available actions included `go_to_convenience_shelf`, `go_to_convenience_register`, and `go_to_convenience_supply_pile`.
- Playwright-based UI verification is still blocked because `node_modules/playwright` is not present in this workspace.
- Follow-up bug fix:
  material collection was working in state, but the UI stayed on the generic location scene because `convenience_scene_discovered` did not exclude `convenience_supply_pile` focus and kitchen intro scenes stayed valid after salvage discovery.
- Fixed scene gating so the player now actually enters the salvage scenes:
  `go_to_convenience_supply_pile` now resolves to `convenience_supply_pile_*` scenes,
  `search_kitchen_backroom` now transitions out of kitchen intro/repeat into `kitchen_salvage_discovered`,
  and `go_to_kitchen_scrap_heap` opens the heap scene with harvest choices.
- Runtime verification after the fix confirmed:
  convenience survey -> `go_to_convenience_supply_pile`
  supply pile focus -> `collect_wood_from_supply_pile`, `collect_cloth_from_supply_pile`, `collect_metal_from_supply_pile`
  after collecting wood -> inventory contained `woodPlank=1`
  kitchen search -> `go_to_kitchen_scrap_heap`
  heap focus -> `collect_scrap_from_kitchen_heap`, `collect_cloth_from_kitchen_heap`
