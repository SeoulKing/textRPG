- Goal: add a second convenience-store stock node for the cash register and let the player collect money from it through the same scene/choice flow.
- Plan: extend stock-node data to support money, wire new money stock conditions/effects, add convenience register scenes/choices, then verify with runtime probes.
- Added money-aware stock-node support:
  `StockNodeDefinition` now has `money`, and new condition/effect variants support `stock_money_gte`, `stock_money_lt`, and `collect_stock_money`.
- Updated runtime helpers and save normalization so money stock is persisted in `stockState` just like item stock.
- Added `convenience_register` to the convenience store with `money: 1800`.
- Reworked `survey_convenience` so it discovers both the shelf and the register, and made it recover gracefully for existing saves that had already found the shelf but not the register.
- Added convenience choices and scenes for:
  `go_to_convenience_register`
  `collect_cash_from_register`
  `leave_convenience_register`
  plus `convenience_register_full`, `convenience_register_low`, and `convenience_register_empty`.
- Verified with a runtime probe:
  convenience intro -> `survey_convenience`
  after survey -> `go_to_convenience_shelf`, `go_to_convenience_register`
  register collects increased money `6500 -> 7100 -> 7700 -> 8300`
  after the third collection the scene became `convenience_register_empty` and only `leave_convenience_register` remained.
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run content:validate` all passed.
- Playwright-based UI verification was not run because `node_modules/playwright` is not present in this workspace.
- Refactored region authoring into `src/game/data/regions/`:
  `shelter/`, `convenience/`, and `kitchen/` now each own their `location.ts`, `choices.ts`, `scenes.ts`, and `events.ts`.
- Top-level `src/game/data/locations.ts`, `choices.ts`, `scenes.ts`, and `events.ts` are now aggregation-only entrypoints so the engine import surface stays stable.
- Updated `OBJECT_MODEL.md` to reflect the new region-module structure and to point edits at `src/game/data/regions/<지역>/...`.
